    The agenda consist of 7 modules about getting started with GCP and it's services including introduction, use cases, demo, Q&amp;A etc. GCP services mainly divided by 4 categories, Compute, Storage, BigData and Machine Learning. As a Web Developer I really interested in Compute and Storage services, for Compute they offer some service model like IaaS, PaaS, Hybrid (Container like Docker) and Serverless. Storage also have several options, Cloud Storage, BigTable (NoSQL), Cloud SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL), Cloud Datastore and Cloud Spanner.
