    Welcome to my brand new blog! Yes, from now on I will begin to share and write posts about many things; starting from programmings, technologies, tutorials, stories, opinios, knowledge sharing, current issues and anything that I found it interesting.

    This is not my first time to start blogging and writing posts, I've been blogging on my <a href="http://www.animanga-sign.com/" target="_blank">other blog</a> for almost 6 years (it's still under constructions though) and writing some posts about Ruby & Rails on my current <a href="http://blog.41studio.com/" target="_blank">company's blog</a> where I currently working.

    I used to blogging on Google's Blogger and WordPress, the two biggest blogging platforms in the universe. At first I planned to to use WordPress for this blog, but after I heard about Ruby-based blogging platform, Jekyll, I decided to use it as base foundation of this blog. I have some reasons why I choose Jekyll:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use the same language, Ruby.</li>
    <li>I like unique concepts of Jekyll itself.</li>
    <li>Simple and customizable, just like what I needs.</li>
    <li>Hosted for free by GitHub Pages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The last one was the main reason why I decided to use Jekyll, LOL. But seriously, I really enjoyed the process of developing and building this blog from scratch until it's suit my desire and what I want, including the designing process, although I'm not expert at web design.
